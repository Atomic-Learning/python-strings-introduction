<h2>Creating Strings</h2>

<p>In Python, you can create a string by putting text between quotation marks. Python accepts both single quotes (<code class="language-python">'</code>) and double quotes (<code class="language-python">"</code>):</p>

<py-cell>greeting = "Hello world"
name = 'Alice'

print(greeting)
print(name)</py-cell>

<p>Some style guides recommend using one type of quote consistently (e.g., always double quotes), but Python itself doesn't enforce this. The key is to be consistent within your codebase.</p>

<h2>Empty Strings</h2>

<p>A string can be empty—containing zero characters:</p>

<py-cell>empty = ""
print(empty) # No text will be displayed because the string is empty</py-cell>

<h2>Valid Characters in Strings</h2>
<p>Strings in Python can contain any valid Unicode characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and even emojis:</p>

<py-cell>exotic_string = ":@123😀🎉"
print(exotic_string)</py-cell>

Some characters may require special handling (such as newlines or tabs), but in general, you can include any character you want in a string.
